                <h1>Some Words About The Project</h1>
                <div class="primaryText">We are standing at the crossroads of history. The latest developments in Artificial Intelligence have irreversibly changed the way we process and deploy information, ushering in a new era of immense innovation and progress.</div>
                <div class="primaryText">The core mission behind the creation of Blackstar is to make LLMs readily accessible to everyone, anywhere, even without an internet connection. Blackstar serves as an alternative to traditional cloud solutions and aims to embrace inclusivity rather than restricting control over this crucial technology to a privileged few.</div>
                <div class="primaryText">The rush for artificial intelligence is the rush for realizing the potential of man, and the potential that arises from this domain are things that exceed the limits of human imagination as much as the concept of an aircraft carrier would have been unfathomable to someone living in ancient Rome. From inconceivable breakthroughs in healthcare and technology, to the transformation of human society itself.</div>
